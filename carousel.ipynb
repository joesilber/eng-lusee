We would likely use an intermediate modulus fiber in a quasi-isotropic, balanced, symmetric layup. Matrix would be 350$^o$F (450 K) cured resin such as Toray RS-3C, commonly used in spacecraft. The design would need to be sufficiently low-strain such that the total temperature change from processing (450 K) down to lunar night (100 K) does not exceed fiber strain limits. A honeycomb sandwich construction would be most mass-efficient, with titanium or aluminum inserts at bolted connections. Thermal expansion effects would be low, several parts per million (ppm) per degree K. Low out-of-plane thermal conductivity would be of some benefit in reducing the heat transfer rate from the turntable to the rest of the spacecraft below it.

    "## Bearings\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bearing type and size\n",
    "The preliminary design (July 2022) packaging acommodates a pair of Kaydon KA025AR0 bearings:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Kaydon KA0xxAR0](figures/kaydon-KA0xxAR0-open-A-bearings.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a thin section, angular contact, open bearing, with bore 2.5\\\" (63.5 mm), O.D. 3.0\\\" (76.2 mm), and thickness 0.25\\\" (6.35 mm). Mass is low, ~0.12 lbs = 55 g. We utilize the common design pattern of mounting in pairs, to provide tilt resistance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stainless steel options (may have custom lead-times and will be more expensive) are available. Replace \"K\" with \"S\" in the part number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kaydon also offers an attractive \"Type X\" four-point contact bearing. We have previously used such a bearing (at a much larger scale) in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) ADC rotator mechanism. The type X controls 5 degrees of freedom in a single unit, rather than the typical angular contact duplex. This has the advantage of fewer parts and less weight, as well as removing the need to control thrust preload in the mounting between the two separate bearing units. A type X unit of similar package size as KA025AR0 would be KA025XP0:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Kaydon KA0xxXP0](figures/kaydon-KA0xxXP0-open-X-bearings.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, replace \"K\" with \"S\" for equivalent stainless option.\n",
    "\n",
    "### External vs internal bearing seals\n",
    "\n",
    "For these open bearings, we would make a dust seal that rides on the shaft and/or flat face. Call this an \"external\" seal. It has the advantages of being:\n",
    "\n",
    "- independent from the bearing selection and procurement\n",
    "- easily replaceable\n",
    "- visible and inspectable\n",
    "- material of our choice (i.e. robust, low cte, temperature tolerant material like polyimide)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can alternatively purchase a bearing with integrated seals. Call this an \"internal\" seal. It has the advantages of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- lower part count\n",
    "- lower mass\n",
    "- more compact packaging\n",
    "\n",
    "Again taking Kaydon as an example bearing manufacturer, their standard seal material is nitrile rubber. This would need to be qualified for our temperature range (100 K - 400 K). Kaydon does offer customization options in alternate seal materials, but we have not yet checked whether polyimide in particular would work for them. Several models Kaydon offers with an integrated double-seal are given in this table:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Kaydon JA0xxXP0](figures/kaydon-JA0xxXP0-sealed-X-bearings.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kaydon line-up does not have sealed bearings in angular contact configurations. \n",
    "\n",
    "For sealed bearings, replace \"J\" with \"W\" in the part number for the stainless option.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bearing seal materials\n",
    "\n",
    "If we fabricate our own seals, one might consider using [Vespel SP-3](https://www.curbellplastics.com/Research-Solutions/DuPont-Vespel-SP-3). This is a 15% MoS<sub>2</sub>-filled polyimide with a long history of use in space applications, with low creep, high strength, and low coefficient of thermal expansion (for a polymer), and which should survive the temperature extremes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A concern I have is that the friction coefficient of SP-3 in vacuum is reported to be very low (0.03) in the Dupont datasheet. Normally lower friction is \"good\" in a bearing, however in our design, having some consistent friction is helpful, to guarantee stability of the position of the turntable stable when powered off. So we probably rather prefer having a consistent friction whether testing in lab air or operating in vacuum. In this respect, unfilled [Vespel SP-1](https://www.curbellplastics.com/Research-Solutions/DuPont-Vespel-SP-1) may be a simpler and better choice. However, the DuPont datasheet does not specifically list a vacuum friction coefficient, so this bears some further investigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphite-filled polyimide grades would not be chosen, since the graphite lubricant can in fact become abrasive in a moisture-free environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Turntable bearings\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some bearings available with more integrated turntable functionality, for example including an external gear profile. An attractive option may be Kaydon T01-00325EAA:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Kaydon turntables - basic](figures/kaydon-turntable-bearings-basic.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "![Kaydon turntables - external gears](figures/kaydon-turntable-bearings-extgear.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "![Kaydon turntables - illustrations](figures/kaydon-turntable-illustrations.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "These turntables are not off-the-shelf parts. Cost and lead-time would be TBD. Performance is not particularly any better than the other options; the attraction here would be the compact packaging. The gearing would need some exterior protection from lunar dust."
